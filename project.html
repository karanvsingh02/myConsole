            <h1>Open Console</h1>
            <br>
            <p>How to set up the App.<p>First, you will need to download the app on your Mac or Desktop. Then, you will need to
                create a new folder. Lastly, attach the the folder to the app by clicking file at the top left corner and after that click "OPEN
                FOLDER" and choose the folder that you downloaded.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What is a console.<p>The console is used to catch and debug errors. If you accidentally make a syntax error
                    then if you go to the console you can find where the bug is. You can get to the console by right clicking on the
                    screen and choose the last option which is "INSPECT". Once you click on it you will get an option on the top right
                    corner saying console. Once you click on it it will tell you if there are any syntax bugs or if it is working 
                    completely fine</p>
